Hackathon and fun for 3-D folding course 

# User manual:

### For getting the basic model RMSD vector and chosen structure PDB file:
1. Run "provide_predictions" function _(after change the PATH_TO_MODELS in the function to the models directory path)_ with path to pdb file argument and      save the returned value as npy file. 
2. Run choose_prediction_basic.py with arguments <path_to_pdb>, <path_to_npy_file_from_the_previous_step>
3. 2 files will be generated: 
   - basic_chosen_reference.pdb - the pdb of the chosen prediction.
   - rmsd_vector_basic.txt - the mean rmsd of all the predictions with the chosen one per position. 


### For color_pdb_by_accuracy.py: üñåÔ∏è
Run <p align="center"> python color_pdb_by_accuracy.py <pdb_file> <score_results.txt> </p> where pdb_file is a .PDB file you want to color and score_results.txt is a .txt file with the data for coloring (in our case, the accuracy). The program outputs a new .PDB file name accuracy_<pdb_file>, which can be colored by accuracy using bfactor (in ChimeraX, write the command "color bfactor"). The output should looks like this: <p align="center">
